                            <p>Hello! I am an artificial intelligence graduate from the University of Malta with a strong background in game development.
                                Iâ€™m a fast learner who thrives on adapting to new challenges and constantly improving.</p>
                            <p>Throughout my time at Raketech, I learnt to adapt quickly, think creatively and
                                manage a team. I quickly advanced to leading a small team with various skills and backgrounds.
                                Our aim was to improve a small network of sites by making them engaging to our target audience,
                                fast, responsive and increase their overall SEO performance.</p>
                            <p>Dorado Games has been the pinnacle of my career so far. It was here that I learned how to
                                drive team growth, collaborate effectively across departments, and deliver high-quality
                                code under pressure. Working on a live game with millions of players worldwide required speed,
                                adaptability, and a strong commitment to standards and performance.
                            </p>
                            <p>The rest of my experience, though unrelated to my line of work,
                                helped me understand the qualities needed to be a good leader and team player.
                                I have also tried my hand at voluntary work which was incredibly rewarding.
                                It was through this type of work that I learned proper time management and
                                coping with new challenges.
                            </p>
                            <p>In my free time I enjoy pottery, reading, gaming and taking part in theatrical performances.</p>
                            <p>I believe that teamwork, organization, having a willingness to learn and good
                                time management are the keys to success!
                            </p>
